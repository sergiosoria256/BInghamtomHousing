        * Consider people that you know to join in the residence (mainly college students)
        * Find people preferably during one semester before (Fall). 
        * Use resources like social media to see if there is someone interested.
        * Provide a good residence description (main information) and contact the owner/landlord to sign the  lease.
 
- look for problems in searching for housing (did you have to go through several websites?)

        * Check the prices of the payments & distance to go to the campus/transportation and parking
