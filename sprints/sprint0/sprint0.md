# **Project Overview**

## **Application Vision/Goal:**
A web application that allows Binghamton students to find housing off-campus. It helps students who are unfamiliar with the area well and 
don't know many other students that they could live with. This also helps students in the overwhelming process of looking for housing as a young adult. The target audience is Binghamton students.

## **Scope:**
- Find housing based off location, price, capacity, and amenities
- Displays nearby bus stops, distance from campus, nearby places (ex. shops, gas station) to the apartment

Nice to have feature:
- Connect with other Binghamton students looking for a similar living situation as you

## **Deliverables:**
An application Binghamton students will be able to use to find housing efficiently and effectively. Specific features include filtering through listings and a map showing the location of the listing.

Nice to have:
- Creating profile for students and a messaging service

## **Success Criteria:**
Making an application which is appealing to students who are looking for housing. Other goals include meetings deadlines and achieving expected functionality by the due date of each sprint.

## **Assumptions:**
Assume Binghamton students are the only ones using this website, it will be a desktop application.

## **Risks:**
Malicious students, stranger danger, resources limited to data shown on realtor websites. Possible fake listings.

## **Design / Architectural Review:**
Will use databases based off real estate data in the area and data scraped from housing websites, major components include a user interface for finding houses based on your preferences, and a map which shows its location compared to campus.

## **Test Environment:**
We will conduct searches to test the functionality of the application. We will provide different price ranges, locations, and other filtereing options to
make sure the application is displaying listings correctly. One possibile testing phase can involve other students using the website and providing feedback.
