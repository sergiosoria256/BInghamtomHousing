## Sprint << 5 >> Review

### SRS Sections Updated

<< List any SRS sections that were updated in the last sprint >>

Registration
* Create a process registration where one student can use their own Binghamton email to register on the website, also having the option to create one if they do not have one.

### User Story

<< Corresponding User Stories completed in this sprint >>

User_stories -> housing_search.md (Have an UI already, more complex and a better version, easy to understand at view in design terms)

### Sprint Requirements Attempted

<< The corresponding SRS requirement that the team completed in the last sprint >>

Registration setup is defined only to consider Binghamton University students.

### Completed Requirements

<< The work that's been completed in this sprint >>
The Registration and a new version of the design of the website were complete.

### Incomplete Requirements

<< The work that has not been completed in this sprint. Be VERY detailed and specific regarding what isn't working and what needs to be completed >>

There are still things to improve, all the main function such as buttons and display of tabs works, but the printing of the full database of properties needs to be shown in properties listings.

Have a better connection/link with Docker files (compose, dockerfile, and requirements)

### The summary of the entire project

<< A general overview of the entire project >>
Carry out and elaborate the web application to help Binghamton University students find housing off-campus and roommates, providing good and trusty web resources.
